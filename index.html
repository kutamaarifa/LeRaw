<h1>Our Story</h1>
<div class="para1"><p>LeRaw Home&Craft was founded in 2019 in Sebokeng, Zone 7. Sebokeng is a township located in the Vaal Region, a region that has been rocked by high women and youth unemployment. Lesego Mpshe, founder and owner, realised that her entrepreneurial spirit and her aptitude for handmade crafts was a strength she could harness for the better of her community. <br> <br>Lesego has taken much inspiration from the Owl. Owls are found in different habitats, which is symbolic of the LeRaw brand which is a multi-sector company in the manufacturing, retail and education sectors. LeRaw has received a number of awards and grants that have helped grow and shape the business. In 2020, funding through the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) was used to purchase equipment that Lesego used to create a micro-factory in a shed in her garden. She uses this space to provide creative sewing skills development within the community through her education institute, LeRaw Craft Academy. This academy caters for those who are creatively intelligent, providing a viable alternative skills development option for those students who do not fit into mainstream education. </p>
